# MerchaCar_stats
## Overview
###
The purpose of this project is to:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The statistical summary of the linear regression is to determine the quality of the dataset. 

1) Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    - mpg: p = 0 < 0.05; statistically significant; non-random amount of variance
